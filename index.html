            <p>DooVR is an application that I'm currently working on. It's a 3D modelling application that lets users create 3D models in Virtual Reality. A more detailed description of the project can be found <a href="http://isafo.github.io/DooVR_showcase/">here</a>.  </p>

            <p>
                Throughout this project I have had a leading role. I have worked with on datastructures, rendering, interface, user testing, calibration and synchronisation of tracking devices, integration of a lot of different APIs and much more.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I have met loads of different people through this project, at conventions, events, research centers and universities. It also lead to a 6 month employment and partnership with a research group at Linköpings University.
            </p>

                <!-- <p>This project began as an idea I had and when I pitched the idea as a bachelor project to my examiner at the time, he approved it. I then worked on the project for about four months with three other people.
         During this time I had a leading role and worked a lot on the datastructures and rendering of the application. I also did a lot of work with the Oculus Rift API and worked on calibrating and synchronising the Oculus system with
         the two different 3D input devices we had available.</p>


         <p>
             During this time I found and contacted a research group at Linköpings University that were developing a new 3D tracking system. They loved the idea of the project and offered a partnership.
             This lead to a three month employment during the summer of 2015 during which I and another member of the bachelor project group (Isabelle Forsman) continued to develop the project.
             The goal was to add support for their new technology and make it more user friendly so that they could use it as a demo-application to showcase their tracking system.
             During the summer we worked mainly with user testing, the user interface and with improving the stability and performance of the application.
             We also added features like saving and loading models and viewing models in a "library".
         </p>

         <p>We continued to work part time with the research group during the fall of 2015. We continued to improve the application
         and attended several conventions and events where we showcased our software and their hardware. This lead to them
         creating a startup.</p>

         <p>
             During late 2015 and beginning of 2016 we created volume based datastructures and modelling methods. Up until then
             all modelling had been done through a surface based method. You can read more about these different methods in the description
             linked above.
         </p>

         <p>
             Currently we are working on moving much of the volume based calculations from the cpu to the gpu to increase performance.

            </h3>

            <p>This was a game that me and 4 other people made in the course TNM061 "3D Graphics" at Linköpings University. It was a game about chasing other players across a futuristic landscape. The gameplay focused on acrobatic movement like sliding, sprinting, wall-running, jumping and jump pads. The following is a video showcasing the movement of the playable character in a small debugging level </p>
