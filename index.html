            </h3>

            <p>DooVR is a 3D modelling application that lets users create 3D models in Virtual Reality. A more detailed description of the project can be found <a href="http://isafo.github.io/DooVR_showcase/">here</a>.  </p>

            <p>
                Throughout this project I have had a leading role. I have worked with on datastructures, rendering, interface, user testing, calibration and synchronisation of tracking devices, integration of a lot of different APIs and much more.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I have met loads of different people through this project, at conventions, events, research centers and universities. It also lead to a 6 month employment and partnership with a research group at Linköpings University.
            </p>

                <!-- <p>This project began as an idea I had and when I pitched the idea as a bachelor project to my examiner at the time, he approved it. I then worked on the project for about four months with three other people.
         During this time I had a leading role and worked a lot on the datastructures and rendering of the application. I also did a lot of work with the Oculus Rift API and worked on calibrating and synchronising the Oculus system with
         the two different 3D input devices we had available.</p>


         <p>
             During this time I found and contacted a research group at Linköpings University that were developing a new 3D tracking system. They loved the idea of the project and offered a partnership.
             This lead to a three month employment during the summer of 2015 during which I and another member of the bachelor project group (Isabelle Forsman) continued to develop the project.
             The goal was to add support for their new technology and make it more user friendly so that they could use it as a demo-application to showcase their tracking system.
             During the summer we worked mainly with user testing, the user interface and with improving the stability and performance of the application.
             We also added features like saving and loading models and viewing models in a "library".
         </p>

         <p>We continued to work part time with the research group during the fall of 2015. We continued to improve the application
         and attended several conventions and events where we showcased our software and their hardware. This lead to them
         creating a startup.</p>

         <p>
             During late 2015 and beginning of 2016 we created volume based datastructures and modelling methods. Up until then
             all modelling had been done through a surface based method. You can read more about these different methods in the description
             linked above.
         </p>

         <p>
             Currently we are working on moving much of the volume based calculations from the cpu to the gpu to increase performance.

            </h3>

            <p>This is a game I'm making in Unreal Engine. I'm trying to make a multiplayer melee fighter where everything is based on physics. No keyframes and no "setWorldPosition()"s only forces, impulses and automatic control. 
                The basic gameplay functionality is implemented and the weapon handling is working somewhat as intended. Before I consider myself done with this project I want to make the weapon handling more dynamic and robust, 
                implement physical biped walking in some capacity and create some solution for synchronizing physics states across several clients.

            <p>
                In this project I have worked with unreal engine, character design, 3D modelling, gameplay programming, animation, particle effects, automatic control, procedural materials and some procedural terrain generation.

            </h3>

            <p>This is a project I worked on as part of the doctorate course TN1008 at Linköpings University. The basics of the algorithm i use is describe <a href="http://physbam.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/papers/stanford2009-02.pdf">here</a>.
                The main algorithm is implemented and working but I still have a lot of optimizing to do before it can be used in a runtime project. Specifically I want to calculate almost everything on the GPU since the algorithm is 
                well suited for GPU calculations. Right now everything is done on a single CPU thread. I also want to explore more partial breaking i.e. not breaking the entire mesh only parts of it.

            <p>This is a project I made in the course DM6122 at Nanyang Technological University. It is a Bspline editor written in c++ using opengl. It uses both uniform and adaptive sampling.  </p>

            <p>
                This project was mostly opengl programming and spline math. I also used glut for window handling and input for the first time. I did it because our proffesor was using it and I had never tried it before.
                It worked ok but I vastly prefer GLFW.

            <p>MCGPU is a project that me and Isabelle Forsman is currently working on. In it we procedurally generate terrain. It is done by procedurally generating a scalar field and then running the marching cube algorithm on it. Both the scalar field generation and marching cube algorithm runs in openGL (on the gpu)  </p>
